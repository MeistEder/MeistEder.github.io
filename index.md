# James Dean

James Byron Dean (February 8, 1931 â€“ September 30, 1955) was an American actor. He is remembered as a cultural icon of teenage disillusionment and social estrangement.
After his death in a car crash, Dean became the first actor to receive a posthumous Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, and remains the only actor to have had two posthumous acting nominations.
In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked him the 18th best male movie star of Golden Age Hollywood in AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars list.
